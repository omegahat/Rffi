<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> No need to write wrapper routines in C/C++
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> No need to know how to write C/C++ code to leverage existing
       C/C++ code. One just has to undestand the essential concepts of
       the C/C++ data structures, pointers to them and memory allocation.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Code is simpler to write, read and maintain as there is no C code.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Can rapidly invoke a native routine and create and populate
       data structures from any foreign/native DLL/DSO.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> Can rapidly prototype using native code.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> All of these mean that we can avoid distracting
      details of writing, compiling, linking and loading
      code to leverage native libraries.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li> We do not need to have development libraries installed, but
       just the  run-time libraries.
  <dd>  To generate the interfaces programmatically (via the
      <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RGCCTUFFI">RGCCTUFFI</a>
        package)  one does  need the header files.
      But for manual construction of the call interface (CIF)
     objects, there is no compiling or linking and so we don't need the
      development libaries agains which we would link.
      

      
</dl>


<h2>Cons</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> Minimal type checking as values are passed from R to native code.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>  Code we write may not be portable as data structures may be
     different on different platforms.  This applies to any C code we
     might write as well and so is not really a reason against using
     FFI.
      However, there will be no error checking performed which would
      occur when compiling C code.
