Title: Interface to libffi to dynamically invoke arbitrary 
     compiled routines at run-time without compiled bindings
Author: Duncan Temple Lang
Imports: methods, utils, RAutoGenRunTime
Depends: 
SystemRequirements: libffi
Maintainer: Duncan Temple Lang <duncan@r-project.org>
Description: This package allows one to use libffi to 
  invoke compiled routines that are dynamically loaded into R
  but for which there are no explicitly compiled bindings.
  This package is both an interface to  functionality
  in the libffi library, and also an additional layer
  of  R classes and functionality for run-time
  interaction with native/compiled code.
  Byron Ellis did some work on this several years ago.

Note: This is an experiment. It relates to RGCCTranslationUnit
  and that is probably a better way to generate interfaces to
  arbitrary code as the resulting bindings will be better type
  checked and faster to implement. This is for dynamic invocation.
  The two packages can be used together at run-time to discover 
  routines and invoke them.
