Version 0.2-0

	*  added many run-time features and methods: alloc(), free(),
	   addFinalizer(), 

	*  support for reading C code via RGCCTranslationUnit and
	   generating R classes and functions to interface to the
	   routines and data structures using Rffi. This will be moved
	   to a separate package in the future.
	
	

Version 0.1-2

	*  Compute the FFI_DEFAULT_ABI dynamically when package is
   	   loaded so correct on different platforms.

Version 0.1-1

	*   Added the libffi source to the package so that people
	don't need to install libffi before installing this package.
	This uses static linking so we don't have to install the
	resulting libffi.so/dylib.
