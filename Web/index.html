<h1>Rffi for run-time invocation of arbitrary compiled routines from R</h1>
<p align=right>Last Release:
 <a href="Rffi_0.3-0.tar.gz"> 0.3-0</a> (<font color="red">26 Jan 2011</font>)


<p> This package provides a way to invoke arbitrary compiled routines
(e.g. C/C++) from within R without having to develop, compile and load
wrappers for those routines in C/C++.  This is an interface to <a
href="http://sourceware.org/libffi/">libffi</a> which provides portable facilities for invoking
foreign/compiled routines based on the types of their parameters and
return value.  The code in libffi takes care of putting the arguments
on the stack and invoking the routine and marshalling the return value
back.  The Rffi package provides a layer on top of this to allow R
objects to be passed as arguments to these routines and for the return
values to be returned as R objects.

<p>
This is an alternative to explicitly writing C/C++ code
to interface to existing C/C++ routines and then
compiling and loading that compiled code in order to be able
to invoke the original compiled routines.
The package allows one to do this entirely within R code
and within an R session rather than ahead of time.

<p>
Because this is dynamic, run-time invocation of arbitrary
routines, there is an overhead that is not present when one
manually  creates interfaces to routines where the parameter
types, etc are known at run-time. Similarly, there is less
protection from passing arguments of the wrong type.  However, there
are benefits to this dynamic system and there are some type checks.

<p>
This package can be combined with meta-computing facilities for getting information
about C/C++ routines automatically (e.g. <a
href="RGCCTranslationUnit">RGCCTranslationUnit</a>
that provide a dynamic mechanism for strongly checked, automated
bindings to arbitrary C/C++ code.
